The tire wasn't leaking air. We didn't know when the tire and wheel suffered the damage. For all we knew, the A3 had been driven for a week or longer in this condition. Sourcing a replacement for the A3's 225\/40R18 Continental ContiProContact TX, however, required some calling around. <\/p>\n\n<p>We first called our tried-and-true provider, <a href=\"\/\/www.stokes-tireservice.com\/\">Stokes Tire Service<\/a>. They didn't have any in stock and Tire Rack wouldn't get another shipment for three weeks. If we could wait, Stokes could order the tire and mount it for $210. A call to another supplier confirmed that the tire was back-ordered from Continental. Our last shot was the local Audi dealer. <\/p>\n\n<p>Santa Monica Audi had a few in stock, with an out-the-door price of $299. It was worth the additional $89 to have the A3 back in service immediately. We made an appointment and dropped off the car at 2:15 p.m. Our advisor said the service center was swamped, but they would try to make time to throw the tire on. He called back at 5:00 to say the A3 was ready to go. Even better than the quick turnaround was the slightly discounted final price of $277.16.<\/p>\n\n<p>We considered replacing its twin tire on the right. The owner's manual states that \"Tires should be replaced at least in pairs and not individually.\" But <em>should<\/em> is not <em>must<\/em>, and the tires only had 6,700 miles on them. We reached out to our contacts at Audi several times for clarification, and as yet have received no response on the matter. <\/p>\n\n<p>The new tire is 1mm thicker than the others, a change of only 0.3%. Changing the second tire would add cost and likely not produce any measurable gain or loss, so ultimately we decided to get the A3 back into service with the single-tire replacement. Call us crazy. Call us reckless. Nearly 5,000 miles later, all is well. <\/p>\n\n<p>Total Cost: $277.16<\/p>\n\n<p>Total Days out of Service: None<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Cameron Rogers, Vehicle Testing Assistant @ 6,728 miles (at the time of replacement)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<@shoppingUnit shopUnitImg=\"\/audi\/a3\/2015\/fd\/2015_audi_a3_f34_fd_617139_185.jpg\" \/>",

    "body" : "<p>  The 2018 Audi A5 is all-new.  Built on the updated modular platform that underpins the current A4 and Q5, its  more creased styling is an attempt to differentiate the new A5 from its  predecessor while bringing it in line with Audi's corporate design language. <\/p>\n<p>Whether the new A5 is more  attractive than the outgoing car is subjective. The changes under the skin are  less controversial. The turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine is new and  has more power (now 252 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque), the  suspension and cabin have been revised and there's a long list of driver  assistance features offered. It's still available with a six-speed manual  gearbox, and for some reason a new seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic has  replaced last year's eight-speed automatic transmission. <\/p>\n<p>Like last year's model, all A5s  are equipped with all-wheel drive (AWD). But there are now two distinct systems  &mdash; A5s equipped with the dual-clutch automatic receive the  traditional, full-time AWD system with a center differential, while models with  the manual gearbox have a revised system. Called &quot;Quattro with Ultra,&quot;  the new system dispenses with the center differential and sends power to the  rear wheels only when needed, saving fuel.<\/p>\n<p>Driver assistance technologies  take center stage with the new A5. Along with full braking in anticipation of  an impending crash, there's available pedestrian detection, blind-spot  monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and intervention, adaptive cruise and a  lane-keeping assistance system. It practically drives itself, and indeed it  nearly does this with the available traffic jam assist system that relieves the  driver of much of the acceleration, braking and steering duties.<\/p>\n<p>The cabin has a big infusion of  convenience features, too. Its updated look and feel include an available  Virtual Cockpit, an extended 12.3-inch high-resolution extended instrument  cluster and MMI touch, which allows commands to be &quot;written&quot; by  touch. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration is standard, and a  head-up display is optional.<\/p>\n<p>There are more ways than ever to  tailor an A5 to your liking. Audiophiles will gravitate toward the optional  Bang &amp; Olufsen premium audio system that boasts a whopping 755 watts and 19  speakers. An optional sport suspension reduces the ride height nearly an inch  and includes larger stabilizer bars, revised dampers and coil springs. Alternatively,  a comfort-oriented suspension package with continuously variable dampers is  also available.<\/p>",

    "body" : "<p>  A new Audi A8 is on the way, and we expect great things from  this redesigned flagship luxury sedan. Under heavy camouflage, we already get  the impression that the styling will be based on the company's Prologue concept  from a few years ago. We expect it to have sharper creases and a more angular  design language than the current model but still be easily recognizable as an  A8. <\/p>\n<p>The bigger news will likely be  the available technology options. Audi has been at the forefront of autonomous  vehicle development, and at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show a small  roundtable discussion revealed that a Level 3 autonomous car is set to go on  sale this year. That means a vehicle that will be self-driving under some  conditions with possible requests for human intervention.<\/p>\n<p>Without naming the A8, Audi  representatives revealed that this car can operate autonomously at speeds under  35 mph and give the driver 10 seconds to respond to interaction requests. Since  most of the Audi lineup has already been revamped in recent years, all signs  point to the A8. <\/p>\n<p>We expect the new A8 to get an auto  show debut sometime this year and go on sale sometime in late 2017 or early  2018. As usual, rivals will include the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and BMW 7 Series.<\/p>",

    "body" : "\n\n<p>In a packed convention hall in Barcelona, Audi unveiled its  flagship luxury sedan, the fourth-generation 2019 <a href=\"\/audi\/a8\/\">A8<\/a>. The company proudly proclaimed it will feature a Level 3  automated driving system as it marches toward the goal of a fully autonomous  vehicle. According to the Society of Automotive Engineers, Level 3 automation  is \"the driving mode-specific performance by an automated driving system  of all aspects of the dynamic driving task with the expectation that the human  driver will respond appropriately to a request to intervene.\" That means  with a touch of a button, the new A8 will be capable of driving itself when  certain conditions are met. If those conditions change, the driver will receive  alerts that intervention will be needed. We have it on good authority that the  driver will have 10 seconds to respond, which is a generous amount of time.<\/p>\n<p>Dubbed \"Audi Piloted Driving,\" this system will  theoretically be effective at speeds up to 60 km\/h, or 37.3 mph. We say  theoretically because the legality of these systems are still being hashed out  worldwide. In the U.S., individual states will be responsible for setting  guidelines for automated and autonomous vehicles, so Piloted Driving  availability will depend on location. If approved, the A8 will be one of the  leaders in what most experts refer to as the next great automotive frontier.<\/p>\n<p>Besides Piloted Driving, the 2019 A8 is all-new from nose to  tail. The design adopts Audi's current design language, featuring a bold  trapezoidal grille up front and a sharply creased character line all the way  down the side. In the back will be a striking band of OLED taillights that will  perform a mini light show as the driver approaches. Audi's reputation for  simple sophistication is on display inside the A8, with a wide horizontal dash  and only the most basic of switches and knobs present. The majority of  functions will be controlled via two large touchscreens in the center stack. <\/p>\n<p>The loss of Audi's MMI controller knob is somewhat concerning  since it is one of the better systems on the market, but we'll hold final  judgment until we get to drive the A8. Though we currently prefer the  knob-based controllers, this new touchscreen system shows promise with large  configurable buttons and a simulated click to confirm each touch. You have to  be very deliberate with touch commands, pushing fairly hard in order to trigger  a function. This will hopefully eliminate inadvertent commands caused by  accidentally brushing the screens.<\/p>\n<p>Mechanically, the new A8 builds on existing technologies. An  advanced active suspension will function much like Mercedes-Benz's Magic Body  Control, using a laser scanner on the road ahead and adjusting each individual wheel  to react to imperfections. In theory, potholes and bumps will no longer be felt  as the car glides unaffected over them. A four-wheel steering system will also  be available, enhancing maneuverability at all speeds and contributing to the  Audi AI Remote Parking Pilot system. Once activated, the driver can direct the  A8 to park itself in a spot without ever having to be in the car, and command  it to exit the spot as well.<\/p>\n<p>As far as engines go, the A8 will debut with a turbocharged  V6 gasoline engine in a mild hybrid system. A V8 model will follow, as will a  plug-in hybrid and a range-topping W12. Expect to see the 2019 Audi A8 in U.S.  showrooms in mid- to late 2018 with prices starting around the $100,000 mark. <\/p>\n\n",

    "body" : "<p>As more and more buyers choose SUVs over cars, automakers  are ensuring all possible desires are met, regardless of price. The trend  toward specialized SUV models that expand brands beyond their usual segments is  on full display at this year's New York Auto Show. The sheer number of high-end  SUVs in New York highlights the rapid expansion of the segment and the  seemingly endless appetite for new and unique offerings at the highest price  points. <\/p>\n<p>&quot;With gas prices at relative lows, the number of  consumers flocking to SUVs continues to grow. In the first three months of  2017, over 40 percent of new vehicle purchases were SUVs for the first time  ever. Growing sales give automakers the freedom to create exciting SUV  derivatives that weren't possible from a business perspective just a few years  ago,&quot; said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds executive director of industry  analysis.<\/p>\n<p>Sitting in the center of the Venn diagram of performance and  luxury at the show this year is the Mercedes-AMG GLC 63. It's a performance  version of the brand's compact SUV that offers up to 503 horsepower thanks to  the same twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8 found in the <a href=\"\/mercedes-benz\/c-class\/2017\/amg-c-63\/\">Mercedes C63<\/a> and GT performance cars.

The <a href=\"\/car-news\/buick-announces-avenir-new-premium-sub-brand.html\">Avenir subbrand<\/a> is new for Buick and it's  designed to offer buyers a more exclusive (and profitable) version of the  standard Enclave through the use of upgraded exterior trim, wheels and interior  materials. The show also marks the North American debut of the Volvo XC60, another  midsize SUV that offers exceptional materials and craftsmanship for buyers  seeking a different kind of SUV experience. <\/p>\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"\/\/services.edmunds-media.com\/image-service\/media-ed\/ximm\/?quality=75&image=\/lincoln\/navigator\/2018\/fd\/2018_lincoln_navigator_actf34_fd_411173_600.jpg\" alt=\"2018 Lincoln Navigator\"><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Full-size SUVs have roared back to life lately, and the new  2018 Lincoln Navigator aims to take advantage of the renewed interest.

    "body" : "<p>For the first time ever, sales of compact and subcompact SUVs  made up more than half of the luxury vehicles sold during the first five months  of the year, according to the latest Luxury Market Report from Edmunds. <\/p>\n<p>Sales of smaller luxury SUVs and crossovers helped brands  such as Audi, Infiniti and Jaguar grab market share from traditional luxury  competitors such as BMW, Lexus and Mercedes-Benz. Through the end of May, Jaguar's sales were up 115  percent, Infiniti's were up 24 percent and Audi's rose by 6 percent, with help  from such compact models as the <a href=\"\/audi\/q5\/2017\/suv\/\">2017  Audi Q5<\/a>, <a href=\"\/infiniti\/qx50\/2017\/\">2017  Infiniti QX50<\/a> and <a href=\"\/jaguar\/f-pace\/2017\/suv\/\">2017 Jaguar F-Pace<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&quot;When the legacy  luxury brands first began offering affordable smaller vehicles, it was seen as  a risk to their brand image, but they were quickly rewarded with new customers  and growing sales,&quot; said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds executive director of  industry analysis. &quot;But now as the smaller luxury brands also start to  diversify their lineups and introduce SUVs that appeal to a broader audience,  the major brands are confronted with a real threat.&quot;<\/p>\n<p>Sales of luxury SUVs of  all sizes have been a major factor in helping shore up automakers in a  moderately declining market. Consumers backed off luxury car models in the  first half of 2017, resulting in a 6 percent drop in sales. Meanwhile, the  best-selling models for 10 of 14 luxury manufacturers during the same period  were SUVs, for a 7 percent overall increase.<\/p>\n<p>A large part of the  appeal of luxury brands is their technology-heavy list of standard and optional  features. Luxury vehicles are generally the first models to get the latest  advanced driver assist, connectivity and safety features, so consumers who want  to be at the forefront of automotive technology are gravitating toward these  vehicles. Automakers have responded by increasing their offerings.<\/p>\n<p>For example, as the  Edmunds report points out, blind-spot monitoring is now available on 81 percent  of luxury models, up from 37 percent in 2012. Adaptive cruise control is  available on 76 percent of models, compared with 50 percent five years ago.<\/p>\n<p>&quot;Luxury shoppers always want the niche, exclusive  choice, and when you offer a product for every price point, that cachet starts  to fade,&quot; said Caldwell. &quot;But as the industry envisions an autonomous  future, the high-end ownership market will start to shift toward vehicles that  offer the best and latest autonomous features and technologies. For many  buyers, these high-tech features create the exclusivity that defines  luxury.&quot;<\/p>\n  <p>\n  For more insights on the latest trends in the luxury market,  read the complete report in the<a href=\"\/industry-center\/\">Edmunds Industry Center<\/a>.<\/p>\n",

    "body" : "<p>The <a href=\"\/audi\/a5\/2018\/hatchback\/review\/\">2018 Audi A5 Sportback<\/a> is a compelling reason  not to abandon the traditional passenger car for an SUV.<\/p>\n<p>Buoyed by the popularity of the A7  Sportback, Audi has brewed up the A5 Sportback and the high-performance S5  Sportback, two flavors of a new four-door hatchback that reside at a more  accessible point in the automaker's range. They're intended to give customers  looking to step up from an A4 sedan or A5 coupe two alternatives to a compact  SUV. Or, not coincidentally, competitors like the BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe.<\/p>\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"\/\/media.ed.edmunds-media.com\/audi\/a5-sportback\/2018\/fe\/2018_audi_a5-sportback_actf34_fe_616171_600.jpg\" alt=\"2018 Audi A5 Sportback\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It's a Hatchback, and That's Grea<\/strong>t<br>\n  Despite its implied relationship to  the automaker's A5 coupe, the A5 Sportback is built on the bones of the A4  sedan. Doing so bestowed the A5 Sportback with the sedan's wheelbase, which is  some 2.4 inches longer than the coupe's. Sheet metal similarities end there  because the A5 Sportback is a new animal from the base of the windshield to the  rear bumper. Incorporating frameless-window doors in lieu of the framed-glass  doors of the A4 and A5 allowed designers of the A5 Sportback to give it with a  more graceful roofline that's 1.6 inches lower than that of the A4. <\/p>\n<p>German automakers have a nagging  habit of referring to rejiggered sedans such as the A5 as &quot;four-&quot; or  &quot;five-door coupes.&quot; Anyone with a functioning hippocampus knows that,  by definition, any car with four doors is categorically not a coupe. What is  actually meant in the misapplication of the coupe labeling is that the car in  question has a racier roofline than the sedan upon which it is based. <\/p>\n<p>Style-oriented though it may be,  the A5 Sportback is the most generously sized member of its immediate family  short of the A4 Allroad wagon. There's 21.8 cubic feet of cargo capacity behind  the A5 Sportback's back seat &mdash; nearly double that of the A5 and  almost 9 cubic feet more than an A4 sedan. Fold down the rear seats and that  number grows to 35 cubic feet. Perhaps the most pleasant surprise is the A5  Sportback's passenger accommodations. Compared to the A4, a bit more headroom  has been liberated up front and there's only a hair less head- and legroom in  the back seat. While the A7 Sportback offers four- or five-passenger seating,  the A5 Sportback sticks with a rear bench seat on all models.<\/p>\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"\/\/media.ed.edmunds-media.com\/audi\/s5-sportback\/2018\/fd\/2018_audi_s5-sportback_prf_fd_614171_600.jpg\" alt=\"2018 Audi S5 Sportback\"><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Standard All-Wheel Drive and a Choice of Engines<\/strong><br>\n  The A5's Sportback's driveline is  lifted intact from the A4, including its traditional Quattro all-wheel-drive  system. It's a mechanical center differential-based system eschewing Audi's  more recent Ultra on-demand system. Quattro is standard on all A5 Sportbacks.  Likewise, all A5 Sportbacks are powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter  four-cylinder engine that generates 252 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of  torque. A seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission is standard. <\/p>\n<p>The engine in the S5 Sportback is a  turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 that develops 354 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque. It's  mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. As in many modern turbocharged  engines, the S5 Sportback's peak torque value is delivered over a plateau, in  this case one that stretches from 1,370 to 4,500 rpm.<\/p>\n<p>Acceleration in the A5 is brisk  despite it weighing nearly 100 pounds more than a comparable A4. Audi says the  A5 Sportback will hit 60 mph in 5.7 seconds and the S5 Sportback in 4.5  seconds.<\/p>\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"\/\/media.ed.edmunds-media.com\/audi\/a5-sportback\/2018\/fe\/2018_audi_a5-sportback_f34_fe_616171_600.jpg\" alt=\"2018 Audi A5 Sportback\"><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>On the Road<\/strong><br>\n  The A5 Sportback's cabin is similar  to that of the A4, meaning it's an especially well-trimmed place. The optional <br>\n  Virtual Cockpit extended instrument cluster is a clever upgrade that delivers  loads of information while the leather and metal elements look and feel  expensive. Despite its lower-profile roof, the interior remains breezy and  never claustrophobic. <\/p>\n<p>It's a car that picks up its feet  gracefully over bumpy pavement but still handles tidily. Body motions are kept  at bay, and the engine's responses seem sharper than in the last A4 we tested.  The steering has natural on-center feel and weighting and enough quickness that  it renders the optional variable-ratio steering (for S5 models) moot. The A5  Sportback punts itself down the road with more oomph than its four-cylinder  billing suggests, though it helps to summon Dynamic mode in the Drive Select  menu since it switches to a more alert shift schedule for the transmission. <\/p>\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"\/\/media.ed.edmunds-media.com\/audi\/s5-sportback\/2018\/fd\/2018_audi_s5-sportback_actr34_fd_614171_600.jpg\" alt=\"2018 Audi S5 Sportback\"><\/p>\n\n<p>The S5 Sportback is decidedly more  rapid, though its thrust is delivered so uniformly that acceleration is  deceptively undramatic. It doesn't make a big show of its speed. Both of the  transmissions in the A5 and S5 deliver smooth gear changes, though neither has  the lightning-quick responses to the manual-shift paddles that enthusiastic  drivers will be looking for. But then, this is more of a grand touring car than  a focused, canyon-dismantling sport sedan. <\/p>\n<p>And in that capacity the A5  Sportback shines. Its seats (particularly those that are part of the S line  sport package) have effective bolsters, plenty of adjustment and the right  amount of give for long-distance driving. Noise levels are well-snubbed, save  for the road noise deriving from the particularly coarse texture of the Pacific  Northwest roads on which we drove. If you want to cover a lot of ground in  style and comfort, the A5 Sportback has, er, your back.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Well Stocked in Any Trim<\/strong><br>\n  The A5 Sportback starts at $43,575,  which is $3,200 more than a similar A4 but $200 less than a base A5 coupe.  Equipment follows established Audi practice of offering three trim levels:  Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige. There's no shortage of features in the base  Premium trim, which comes standard with a power liftgate, keyless ignition,  leather upholstery, three-zone automatic climate control, a panoramic sunroof  and a dose of driver assistance features. <\/p>\n  \n<p><img data-dsrc=\"\/\/media.ed.edmunds-media.com\/audi\/a5-sportback\/2018\/fe\/2018_audi_a5-sportback_dsh_fe_61611_600.jpg\" alt=\"2018 Audi A5 Sportback\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Stepping up to Premium Plus is  likely where most folks will end up, what with its balance of additional  convenience and luxury features. Full-pop Prestige models come with premium  audio, upgraded MMI infotainment and an enhanced parking assistance system and command  a heady $51,175 before you select &agrave; la carte options.<\/p>\n<p>At that point, you might also  consider the more potent S5 Sportback, which starts at $55,375 with Premium  Plus as the starting trim level. Keep your urges in control &mdash; if you  spring for the Prestige trim and then go on a box-ticking spree, the S5  Sportback can crest $67,000.<\/p>\n<p>Artfully balancing good looks,  performance and function at price points that make sense, the A5 Sportback and  S5 Sportback convincingly round out Audi's middle-ground product range. Breathe  easy if you thought your next move had to be into a compact SUV. You now have  an excellent alternative. <\/p>\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"\/\/media.ed.edmunds-media.com\/audi\/s5-sportback\/2018\/fd\/2018_audi_s5-sportback_r34_fd_614171_600.jpg\" alt=\"2018 Audi S5 Sportback\"><\/p>\n",

    "body" : "<p>The first-generation Audi S5 stuck around for a decade, which  in car years made it an elder statesman. Thanks to its shapely styling, refined  interior, sharp driving dynamics and some evolutionary updates over the years,  the S5 remained competitive among luxury sport coupes. There were only so many  updates that could be executed before a full redesign was needed and this  nose-to-tail rethink has hit at precisely the right time.<\/p>\n  <p>\n  The <a href=\"\/audi\/s5\/2018\/coupe\/\">2018 Audi S5<\/a> is all-new, but it retains a lot of  what gave its predecessor such an unusually long lifespan. The sleek exterior  design remains, though with a bit more visual gimmickry. The creases in the  sheet metal are sharper, and a few more have been added to the hood. The face  is more angular and stretched horizontally to fit in with the rest of the Audi  lineup. We contend that some of the grace has been replaced by aggression, and  for a car with a greater emphasis on performance, that's not such a bad thing. <\/p>\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"\/\/services.edmunds-media.com\/image-service\/media-ed\/ximm\/?quality=75&image=\/audi\/s5\/2018\/fd\/2018_audi_s5_f34_fd_404171_600.jpg\" alt=\"2018 Audi S5 \"><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Plenty of Available  Options<\/strong><br>\n  The 2018 Audi S5 slots in between the new 252-horsepower A5  that is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and the 450-hp  RS5 and its twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6. With 354 hp and 369 pound-feet of torque  coming from a single turbo 3.0-liter V6, this latest S5 gains 6 percent more  horsepower and 13 percent more torque over the previous model. An eight-speed  automatic is the only transmission offered, and all-wheel drive is also  mandatory. <\/p>\n<p>Prices start around $55,000 for the base Premium Plus trim  with features such as 18-inch wheels with summer tires, a sunroof, adjustable  drive modes, diamond-stitched leather and suede upholstery, heated front sport  seats with power-adjustable side bolsters and massage functions. On the  technology side, the S5 Premium Plus gets Audi's MMI infotainment system with a  7-inch display, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, low-speed frontal collision  warning and mitigation, and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic  alert. <\/p>\n<p>The Prestige trim will set you back another $4,400 and adds a  head-up display, a surround-view camera system, a navigation system, an  8.3-inch display, a premium Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system, and the Audi  Connect system with Wi-Fi hotspot, vehicle monitoring and some remote feature  control through an app. Other options include the S Sport package (adaptive  suspension and sport rear differential) and the Driver Assistance package  (adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, automatic high beams and a  traffic sign reader). Our test vehicle included all of these and more, pushing  the price to almost $70,000.<\/p>\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"\/\/services.edmunds-media.com\/image-service\/media-ed\/ximm\/?quality=75&image=\/audi\/s5\/2018\/fd\/2018_audi_s5_actf34_fd_404171_600.jpg\" alt=\"2018 Audi S5 \"><\/p>\n<p><strong>Performance You Can Use<\/strong><br>\n  If you're considering an S5, it's very likely you place  greater emphasis on performance than most. For drivers like you, the 2018 Audi  S5 will satisfy with its smooth and linear power delivery. There's a brief  hesitation from a stop, but once underway the S5 gathers speed effortlessly  with gearshifts that are almost seamless. In Comfort mode, the engine and  exhaust emit a pleasantly sporty hum. Switch to Dynamic mode and the hum  becomes louder while the throttle response sharpens, steering effort increases  and, if equipped, the suspension stiffens.<\/p>\n<p>Audi claims the S5 will reach 60 mph in 4.4 seconds and we're  inclined to believe it. As we accelerated up highway on-ramps, we consistently  had to ease off the throttle when we surpassed extra-legal speeds, not to  mention the flow of traffic. You don't get the kind of punch in the gut that  makes passengers claw for grab handles, though. The &quot;hey, watch this&quot;  kind of theatrics are replaced by an &quot;I got this, no problem&quot; type of  veteran confidence. It's impressive without being scary.<\/p>\n<p>The same holds true for handling. You can rip through curves  with ridiculous speeds and never doubt the S5's ability. With sticky summer  tires, it takes considerable effort to make them squeal and the Quattro  all-wheel-drive system constantly distributes power to the appropriate wheels without  any indication that it's happening. What's more extraordinary is how  approachable the S5 makes this kind of driving. Much of the credit goes to  mechanical expertise, but without smart technology that calm assurance would  surely be lost.<\/p>\n<p>Left in automatic mode, the transmission drops down a few  gears right where we would have it in manual mode. The downshifts are heard but  rarely felt, and in Dynamic mode, you won't be rushed into a higher gear until  you're making an appropriate amount of power. Manual remains our preferred mode  when driving with verve, supplying an aggressive paddle-shift punch that will  bring a smile to any spirited driver. Purists will still bemoan the lack of a  true manual transmission, but if that's a deal breaker, it's their loss. The  latest batch of automatics are simply brilliant, and the argument of &quot;I  just like a stick and clutch pedal&quot; is getting weaker every year. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Comfortable Through  Corners<\/strong><br>\n  Most drivers with a penchant for performance are willing to  sacrifice some comfort, but with the 2018 S5, the compromises are minimal. Yes,  the ride quality is a bit stiffer than the typical luxury coupe, but not to any  objectionable level. Even in Dynamic mode, there's enough compliance to filter  out any harshness, and in Comfort mode, a wider array of bumps are smoothed  over. The summer tires create a noticeable amount of road noise on coarse  asphalt, but on most other surfaces, you'd have to turn the radio off to hear  it. Wind noise is largely absent, which makes for quiet and comfortable highway  cruising.<\/p>\n<p>The front sport seats have aggressive side bolsters to keep  you firmly anchored in turns, but they're power-adjustable with plenty of range  to accommodate larger occupants. Extendable thigh extensions and massage  functions make them even more comfortable. Ventilated seats are available, but  not with the adjustable side bolsters. In warmer weather, the seats never felt  stifling, so we'd pass on that option.<\/p>\n<p>Rear seat space is typical for coupes in this class, which  means they're not that well suited to adults. There's enough room for a quick  trip, but only smaller passengers will be comfortable back there for longer  journeys. If rear passenger space is a necessity, the mechanically similar S4  sedan is a better choice.<\/p>\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"\/\/services.edmunds-media.com\/image-service\/media-ed\/ximm\/?quality=75&image=\/audi\/s5\/2018\/fd\/2018_audi_s5_fint_fd_404171_600.jpg\" alt=\"2018 Audi S5 \"><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Refined and Well-Built Interior<\/strong><br>\n  Like the rest of the Audi lineup, the S5's interior is  elegantly simple. Leather and suede are used liberally throughout the cabin,  and other surfaces are sturdy and well-grained for a premium look and feel.  Available contrasting stitching and carbon-fiber accents hint at the coupe's  sporting intent without being blatant. Technology is also tastefully brought  into the mix with a virtual instrument panel and infotainment screen mounted on  a tabletlike panel atop the dash.<\/p>\n<p>Only often-used buttons are present, and their logical  placement won't distract the driver. Some switches serve multiple purposes,  further enhancing the uncluttered appearance while also making them easier to  use. For example, nudging the volume knob left or right will skip the audio  track while the use of two raised toggle switches for navigation, phone, radio  and media allow for operation without ever having to take your eyes off the  road. The inclusion of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto also help to keep the  driver focused on the task at hand. Secondary functions are controlled through  Audi's MMI interface, which is one of the easier units to operate. <\/p>\n<p>The available virtual instrument panel may seem like a  novelty at first, but the clear manner in which it delivers information more  than justifies its existence. The screen can be configured in several modes  focused on performance, navigation and trip information using a few knobs and  buttons on the steering wheel. The display is easy to read at a glance and  isn't prone to glare from off-angle sunlight, either. A head-up display  projects relevant information onto the windshield for distraction-free driving.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to all the refinement and technology, the S5  scores well when it comes to convenience. Up front, there are enough  cupholders, bins and pockets to store your personal items. Cargo capacity isn't  the biggest in the class, but at 11.6 cubic feet of unobstructed space, there's  plenty of room for luggage. A flat floor, split-folding rear seats and wide  opening easily handle larger items.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Top Coupe in the Class<\/strong><br>\n  The 2018 Audi S5 is the newest entry in the luxury sport  coupe segment. It follows just a few months behind the Mercedes-Benz AMG C43,  while the BMW 4 Series has been refreshed for the 2018 model year. Similarly  equipped, all three German rivals will cost about the same. The S5 gets an edge  for how reactive and engaging it is to drive without any appreciable sacrifices  in comfort. The Mercedes C43 also gets high marks in these areas, but with a  greater emphasis on traditional luxury. The BMW splits the difference in some  ways, but it does feel a bit heavier behind the wheel and isn't as fresh as it  was four years ago. <\/p>\n<p>It's a close battle between the Audi and the Mercedes. So  close that personal preference will likely play a bigger role in the decision  than any other factor. Both are at the top of their class, but we'd choose the  S5 by the narrowest of margins. If you're in the market, we suggest a very  thorough test drive of both. Either way, you'll get stirring performance, a  comfortable ride and a sly smile every time you fire one up.<\/p>\n",

But it's not always easy to sort out which sedans are the very safest, and we bring you this list to make the job easier. It shows the 2017 sedans that have received both the highest rating, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iihs.org\/iihs\/ratings\/TSP-List\" target=\"_blank\">Top Safety Pick+<\/a>, from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) andthe top five-star overall rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's <a href=\"\/\/www.nhtsa.gov\/ratings\" target=\"_blank\">5-Star Safety Ratings<\/a> testing. NHTSA does not test all cars, however, so we've also included 2017 sedans that have not been tested by NHTSA but that have received the IIHS Top Safety Pick+ rating. <\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, all the sedans on this list have the safety equipment that federal law requires, including front-seat airbags for the driver and front passenger, tire-pressure monitoring systems and electronic stability control (ESC). ESC incorporates antilock brakes and traction control. <\/p>\n\n<p>We've also listed some of the key safety features in each car and safety-related extras that might interest you. When Edmunds has tested a vehicle, we show the results of our own brake tests. The cars are listed alphabetically within three size groups: compact, midsize and large sedans. We've also included four-door hatchbacks, such as the 2017 Toyota Prius and the Prius Prime plug-in hybrid, that meet our \"safest\" criteria. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Compact
