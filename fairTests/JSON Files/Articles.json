Thanks to an advanced torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive system (SH-AWD), the MDX is one of the sportier three-row SUVs on the market for drivers so inclined. Its buttery-smooth V6 engine is another strong point, offering acceleration comparable to some European rivals yet returning respectable fuel economy, too. There were some drivability issues with the nine-speed automatic transmission upon its introduction last year, but a software update this year aims to provide a solution.",

                  "body" : "<h3>2015 Acura TLX: The Accord Problem<\/h3>\n<p>by Josh Sadlier, Senior Editor on December 30, 2015<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/\/services.edmunds-media.com\/image-service\/media-ed\/ximm\/?quality=85&image=\/acura\/tlx\/2015\/lt\/2015_acura_tlx_f34_lt_1228151_717.jpg\" alt=\"2015 Acura TLX\" \/><\/p>\n<p>At the 2016 Malibu <a href=\"\/chevrolet\/malibu\/2016\/road-test\/\">press event<\/a> a few weeks ago, Chevy was kind enough to supply a base 2016 Honda Accord LX for comparison drives. We rarely get base-model test cars at the home office &mdash; they just don't exist in most press fleets &mdash; so it was a rare opportunity to put a stripped-down midsize sedan through its paces. <\/p>\n<p>Except that this particular base Accord wasn't stripped-down at all. For an MSRP of $22,105, Honda provides alloy wheels, automatic headlights, LED taillights, dual-zone automatic climate control, Bluetooth and a USB port. There's also a 7.7-inch central infotainment screen that looks and operates much like the one in our long-term <a href=\"\/acura\/tlx\/2015\/sedan\/\">2015 Acura TLX<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, our TLX SH-AWD Advance packs a bunch more gewgaws and doohickeys than the Accord LX. But it had better, because you could have two base Accords for this TLX's <a href=\"\/acura\/tlx\/2015\/long-term-road-test\/introduction.html\">$45,720<\/a> asking price.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/\/services.edmunds-media.com\/image-service\/media-ed\/ximm\/?quality=85&image=\/acura\/tlx\/2015\/lt\/2015_acura_tlx_fint_lt_1228152_717.jpg\" alt=\"2015 Acura TLX\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I'm focusing on Honda's midsizer here because in case you weren't aware, the TLX is essentially a luxe-ified Accord. As we point out in our <a href=\"\/acura\/tlx\/2016\/sedan\/review\/\">model review<\/a>, the cars share a 109.3-inch wheelbase and even offer roughly the same engines: a 2.4-liter four-cylinder and a 3.5-liter V6. Sure, the four-cylinder TLX comes with an exclusive eight-speed dual-clutch transmission that does fun things, but the Accord's remarkably responsive CVT is a gem in its own right. It's the first CVT I've genuinely enjoyed operating. <\/p>\n<p>As for the V6 models, the TLX technically trumps the Accord's 6-speed automatic with its <a href=\"\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ZF_9HP_transmission\" target=\"_blank\">9-speed ZF unit<\/a>, but if every TLX 9-speed shifts <a href=\"\/acura\/tlx\/2015\/long-term-road-test\/2015-acura-tlx-awkward-conversations.html\">the way our long-termer does<\/a>, I'd rather have the Honda.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/\/services.edmunds-media.com\/image-service\/media-ed\/ximm\/?quality=85&image=\/acura\/tlx\/2015\/lt\/2015_acura_tlx_fint_lt_1228153_717.jpg\" alt=\"2015 Acura TLX\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We were talking about the Accord LX versus the TLX SH-AWD Advance, though, which means four-cylinder\/CVT versus V6\/9-speed. Oh, and front-wheel drive versus all-wheel drive. If you want the latter, the Accord (like most mainstream sedans) can't oblige. <\/p>\n<p>But I have to tell you, I never found myself wanting more power in that Accord LX. Once the CVT &quot;downshifts&quot; on the highway, you're good to go. Plenty of scoot. And having grown up in Maine driving only two-wheel-drive vehicles, without a single scar to show for it, I personally don't see the need for AWD in a passenger car, especially with modern stability and traction control systems in the mix. <\/p>\n<p>I guess if you <a href=\"\/acura\/tlx\/2015\/long-term-road-test\/2015-acura-tlx-sh-awd-is-pretty-cool.html\">drive it like Brent did<\/a>, you might enjoy the performance benefits of SH-AWD, but tell me: Are those fleeting moments worth the extra cash, not to mention paying to <a href=\"\/acura\/tlx\/2015\/long-term-road-test\/2015-acura-tlx-pricey-second-service.html\">service the differential<\/a> every 7,500-15,000 miles?<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/\/services.edmunds-media.com\/image-service\/media-ed\/ximm\/?quality=85&image=\/acura\/tlx\/2015\/lt\/2015_acura_tlx_det_lt_1228154_717.jpg\" alt=\"2015 Acura TLX\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Hey, I get it. Luxury goods are nice. You look around from the TLX's driver seat and you see more style on the dashboard, more contours on the front seatbacks, just more flair overall. Plus, those Accord LX <a href=\"\/\/automobiles.honda.com\/images\/2016\/accord-sedan\/configurations\/base-cars\/MS_lx_34FRONT.png\" target=\"_blank\">wheels<\/a> hurt my eyes. The differences are real. <\/p>\n<p>But I'm reminded of a time when I was driving in Boston and got lost in a particularly tony section of Cambridge. Huge houses, big gates in front, the whole deal. I saw multiple late-model Accords parked behind those gates. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To me, that's smart money.<\/p>\n<p><em>Josh Sadlier, Senior Editor<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",

                  "body" : "<p>Hybrid technology typically works best in the fuel-efficient  domain of small hatchbacks, but it's making an important appearance in the new  2017 Acura MDX Sport Hybrid. By borrowing technology from the Acura's RLX  Hybrid and NSX sports car, Acura promises that the MDX Sport Hybrid will have  superior performance and efficiency compared to a regular MDX. And to a large  extent, it delivers.<\/p>\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"\/\/media.ed.edmunds-media.com\/acura\/mdx-sport-hybrid\/2017\/fd\/2017_acura_mdx-sport-hybrid_group_fd_407171_600.jpg\" alt=\"2017 Acura MDX Sport Hybrid\"><\/p>\n\n\n  <p>\n  For performance, the all-wheel-drive MDX Sport Hybrid gets  its power from a 3.0-liter V6 paired with a lithium-ion battery pack and three  electric motors. There's a twin electric-motor setup in the rear and a single  motor up front. Put all that together and the MDX Sport Hybrid produces a  maximum of 321 horsepower and 289 pound-feet of torque. That's a decent gain  compared to the standard MDX, which provides 290 hp and 267 lb-ft of torque.<\/p>\n<p>But there's extra heft associated with the batteries and  electric motors. The MDX Sport Hybrid weighs over 200 pounds more than the  standard MDX. According to Acura, the Hybrid is no quicker accelerating from  zero to 60 mph. And you can forget about towing. The standard MDX is rated to  tow up to 5,000 pounds, but for the Sport Hybrid, towing is simply not  recommended.<\/p>\n<p>Hmm. So, it's not any quicker and you can't tow with it. Kind  of lame, right? But there are other, less obvious performance benefits. The Hybrid  is definitely more enjoyable to drive. The extra torque provided by the MDX's  electric motors makes for a smoother driving experience both in the city and on  the highway. At multiple points during our test drive of the MDX Sport Hybrid,  the 3.0-liter V6 cut out, the MDX switched over to the battery power, and the  transition between electric and internal combustion power was seamless. The  seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission in the MDX Sport Hybrid is also  significantly more refined than the nine-speed automatic you'll find in the  standard MDX. It provides smoother shifts when you hit the gas pedal to execute  a passing maneuver.<\/p>\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"\/\/media.ed.edmunds-media.com\/acura\/mdx-sport-hybrid\/2017\/fd\/2017_acura_mdx-sport-hybrid_actf34_fd_407171_600.jpg\" alt=\"2017 Acura MDX Sport Hybrid\"><\/p>\n\n\n<p>We also like the way the 2017 Acura MDX Sport Hybrid handles  and drives. It has adaptive suspension dampers and four selectable driving  modes: Comfort, Normal, Sport or Sport+. These modes adjust steering effort,  suspension stiffness and throttle response, and Acura has even gone to the  trouble of pairing the preferred driving modes to specific keys. This means  that different drivers in the same family can select their default mode for  whenever they're behind the wheel and the drive modes (other than Sport+) will  remain selected even after the vehicle is turned off. All of this probably  sounds pretty standard if you're in the market for a sports car, but for  hybrid, three-row crossover shoppers, this certainly isn't the norm. The Sport  Hybrid is surprisingly capable, and you'll feel confident driving it around  corners.<\/p>\n  <p>\n  When it comes to fuel economy, the MDX Sport Hybrid now sits  right near the top of its class. Granted, there aren't a lot of luxury,  three-row, hybrid crossovers available (especially ones with &quot;Sport&quot;  in the name), but what the MDX can do is still impressive. The standard MDX is  rated at an EPA-estimated 21 mpg combined (18 city\/26 highway). (In our <a href=\"\/acura\/mdx\/2014\/long-term-road-test\/wrap-up.html\">long-term test of a  2014 MDX<\/a>, we found  those numbers to be more than achievable.) This MDX Sport Hybrid is rated at 27  mpg combined (26 city\/27 highway), which puts it up there with the  all-wheel-drive Infiniti QX60 Hybrid (26 mpg combined) but still less than the  two-row Lexus RX 450h (30 mpg combined).<\/p>\n  \n<p><img data-dsrc=\"\/\/media.ed.edmunds-media.com\/acura\/mdx-sport-hybrid\/2017\/fd\/2017_acura_mdx-sport-hybrid_dsh_fd_407171_600.jpg\" alt=\"2017 Acura MDX Sport Hybrid\"><\/p>\n\n  <p>\n  On the inside, the 2017 Acura MDX Sport Hybrid has lovely  wood grain on the dash and soft but supportive leather seating surfaces. It's  muffled and quiet over broken road surfaces, and it comes with a lot of safety  equipment such as forward collision warning and mitigation and lane departure  intervention. What's more, the Hybrid doesn't lose any space in the back, still  providing 68.4 cubic feet of cargo space behind the front seats. <\/p>\n  \n  \n<p><img data-dsrc=\"\/\/media.ed.edmunds-media.com\/acura\/mdx-sport-hybrid\/2017\/fd\/2017_acura_mdx-sport-hybrid_crg_fd_407171_600.jpg\" alt=\"2017 Acura MDX Sport Hybrid\"><\/p>\n\n\n<p>The controls are still all regular MDX, however, including  the dual-screen infotainment system. This system can be distracting to use,  with a steep learning curve for the basic functions that control audio and  navigation. It also looks out of place in a seemingly premium vehicle.<\/p>\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"\/\/media.ed.edmunds-media.com\/acura\/mdx-sport-hybrid\/2017\/fd\/2017_acura_mdx-sport-hybrid_cc_fd_407171_600.jpg\" alt=\"2017 Acura MDX Sport Hybrid\"><\/p>\n\n  <p>\n  Overall, though, we like the 2017 Acura MDX Sport Hybrid.  Just the name itself may seem a bit strange, even a bit oxymoronic to some, but  it is significantly more efficient than a standard MDX and surprisingly good to  drive, succeeding on both fronts and ultimately improving on an already  first-rate family vehicle. <\/p>\n",

                  "body" : "<p>From the beginning, Acura has built  sporty, well-engineered cars. Aside from a few notable models (NSX, Integra  Type-R), Acuras weren't hard-core sports cars. Instead, they were much more  focused on being livable for the average driver with comfortable cabins, modern  technology and clean designs. In recent years, things have been different.  While the cars still had comfortable cabins and modern technology, Acura's  designs have put off some traditional customers who were looking for more edge  in the designs. <\/p>\n<p>Our concerns for Acura's design  language were allayed upon the reveal of the <a href=\"\/car-news\/first-impressions\/2018-acura-tlx-first-look.html\">2018 Acura TLX<\/a> at the 2017 New York Auto Show.  Instead of the &quot;power plenum grille&quot; design that's been used since  the launch of the 2009 TL, Acura introduced a new &quot;diamond pentagon  grille.&quot; We find this new design language much more agreeable and, along  with some new bodywork, Acura has elevated the Acura TLX from being just a roomy  and quiet car to something far more interesting. <\/p>\n\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"\/\/media.ed.edmunds-media.com\/acura\/tlx\/2018\/fd\/2018_acura_tlx_rear_fd_517171_600.jpg\" alt=\"2018 Acura TLX \"><\/p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Breaking Down What's New<\/strong><br>\n  The TLX is available in three  distinct styling flavors for 2018. The base model uses the same 2.4-liter  inline four-cylinder engine (206 horsepower, 182 pound-feet) as before along  with an eight-speed transmission that sends power to the front wheels. Those  wheels measure 17 inches in diameter and feature a new design to complement the  revised front-end styling. <\/p>\n<p>Stepping up to the standard V6 model  presents additional styling changes to the rear of the car that include an  underbody diffuser and rectangular exhaust outlets along with 18-inch wheels  and tires. New for 2018 is a performance-oriented A-Spec trim level that gets  its own unique front-end treatment, extended side sills, round exhaust outlets,  dark finish 19-inch wheels and a rear deck spoiler. <\/p>\n<p>Either of the V6 models can be  equipped with Acura's SH-AWD (super handling, all-wheel-drive) system. <\/p>\n<p>There are notable updates to the  interior of the new TLX as well. All models come with a new 7-inch touchscreen  display that features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration along with HD  radio. All TLXs also get AcuraWatch, which is Acura's driver assistance system  that includes emergency braking, forward collision warning, adaptive cruise  control, lane keep assist, and lane departure warning (Acura calls it  &quot;road departure mitigation&quot;). Other standard features include a  rearview camera, heated front seats, 10-way power driver's seat and eight-way  power front passenger seat, dual-zone climate control, power moonroof, and dual  color displays. <\/p>\n<p>Like the previous TLX, the 2018  version offers a Technology package on the base model. It builds out the  AcuraWatch system with the addition of a blind-spot indicator, rear cross  traffic alert, auto unlocking doors, rain-sensing wipers, navigation system, and a 10-speaker audio system.  The V6 TLX can also be upgraded with the Technology package, which includes the  same features as the four-cylinder along with a power driver's seat thigh  extender. An even more comprehensive Advance package is also available on V6 models  with a surround-view camera, wireless charging system for your smartphone,  interior ambient lighting, ventilated front seats, remote start and heated  seats, a heated windshield and even a heated steering wheel. <\/p>\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"\/\/media.ed.edmunds-media.com\/acura\/tlx\/2018\/fd\/2018_acura_tlx_dsh_fd_517171_600.jpg\" alt=\"2018 Acura TLX \"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Still Solid From Behind the Wheel<\/strong><br>\n  We drove a top-of-the-line Advance  trim equipped with Acura's SH-AWD system, and a sporty A-Spec model, also with  SH-AWD. We found the 3.5-liter V6 engine to be smooth, responsive and notably  aggressive sounding, too. Other than some harsh shift quality between the  fourth and fifth gears, the SH-AWD system and nine-speed transmission work well  together. <\/p>\n<p>Manually shifting the transmission  via the steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters results in sufficiently quick  shifts, with the shift quality increasing in speed and severity when the car is  placed in Sport and Sport+ mode. Brakes were reactive and easy to modulate,  with the torque-vectoring system doing its best to carefully toe the line and  ensure relatively neutral handling bias.<\/p>\n<p>We spent more time in the A-Spec  version to see how its upgrades feel compared to the standard models. In  addition to its unique styling, the A-Spec model gets a larger wheel-tire  package, quicker steering ratio and a stiffer suspension. We noted some  additional road noise compared against the Advance variant, but steering  feedback through the smaller A-Spec specific sport steering wheel is improved.  Performancewise, there's more grip from the larger performance-oriented  all-season tires, with sharper turn-in. While it's a sportier and more engaging  car to drive on a twisty road, we believe traditional buyers may prefer the  quieter and slightly calmer handling experience found on the regular models. <\/p>\n\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"\/\/media.ed.edmunds-media.com\/acura\/tlx\/2018\/fd\/2018_acura_tlx_actf34_fd_517172_600.jpg\" alt=\"2018 Acura TLX \"><\/p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Blast From the Past<\/strong><br>\n  Compared to our former long-term <a href=\"\/acura\/tlx\/2015\/long-term-road-test\/\">2015 Acura TLX<\/a>, the most notable change is the  front fascia, which is surprisingly an area we didn't receive many complaints  about. Other complaints during our tenure came from the sluggish infotainment  system, abrupt stop-start system and transmission shift quality. We're happy to  report the infotainment system is smoother and faster reacting, and the ability  to have Apple CarPlay or Android Auto display on the upper screen while leaving  the audio and climate on the lower screen finally justifies the dual-screen  layout. The stop-start system is unchanged, but the button to disable the  system remains. Finally, the transmission does work better, but as mentioned  before, the lazy fourth-to-fifth gearshift is lazy. <\/p>\n<p>When the 2018 Acura TLX goes on sale  on June 1, it should have a good chance of capturing a greater slice of the  entry-level luxury sedan market. Not only does it offer more equipment, the  addition of the A-Spec model provides a new dimension to the model that was  missing, especially for those who yearned for the sportier Acuras of the past.  If that's not your thing, rest assured that the standard models still offer the  kind of easy-to-live-with luxury that makes all Acuras so enjoyable to drive. <\/p>\n",

New styling on the exterior, a  more robust suite of technology on the inside and more standard safety features  are all part of the package for the 2018 model year. It might seem a little  early for such an extensive update, but sedans like the TLX are having a tough  time competing against similarly sized SUVs, so anything that can inject some  life is worth a shot. <\/p>\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"\/\/services.edmunds-media.com\/image-service\/media-ed\/ximm\/?quality=75&image=\/acura\/tlx\/2018\/as\/17\/ny\/2018_acura_tlx_group_17-ny-as_410171_600.jpg\" alt=\"2018 Acura TLX\"><\/p>\n\n\n<p>The new styling of the TLX is an evolution of the direction  first shown on the <a href=\"\/car-news\/acura-precision-concept-sets-future-design-direction-2016-detroit-auto-show.html\">Acura Precision concept  car,<\/a> which debuted  in early 2016. It's a more angular look compared to Acura's past designs, and  it gives the TLX a more aggressive appearance up front. The grille, the air dam  and the lights have all been revamped along with revised fenders and side  skirts. There are updates to the rear as well, but they're limited to the V6  models only. All the updates are subtle so you may not even notice many of them  at first glance. Taken together, however, they make the TLX look a little more  finished, more distinctive, too. <\/p>\n<p>New for 2018 is the addition of the TLX A-Spec trim, a  high-end, performance-oriented model that gets its own unique exterior trim  along with a retuned suspension and revised steering. A-Spec trim is available  on both front- and all-wheel-drive models, the latter getting stiffer springs  and a rear anti-roll bar as part of the package. A set of 19-inch wheels and  wider wheels come standard as well. Interior upgrades include leather sport  seats, aluminum trim and a heftier steering wheel. There are no engine upgrades,  so hopefully the standard 290-horsepower V6 is enough for you.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"\/\/services.edmunds-media.com\/image-service\/media-ed\/ximm\/?quality=75&image=\/acura\/tlx\/2018\/as\/17\/ny\/2018_acura_tlx_fint_17-ny-as_410171_600.jpg\" alt=\"2018 Acura TLX\"><\/p>\n\n\n<p>All 2018 TLX models get an updated user interface that offers  Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality along with an improved touchscreen  that's more responsive to inputs, according to Acura. The TLX also comes  standard with all of Acura's latest electronic safety systems, including  automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist and  forward collision warning. <\/p>\n<p>No pricing announced yet, but the TLX goes on sale in June so  it won't be long.

But it's not always easy to sort out which SUVs are the very safest, and we bring you this list to make the job easier. It shows the 2017 SUVs that have received both the highest rating, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iihs.org\/iihs\/ratings\/TSP-List\" target=\"_blank\">Top Safety Pick+<\/a>, from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) andthe top five-star overall rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's <a href=\"\/\/www.nhtsa.gov\/ratings\" target=\"_blank\">5-Star Safety Ratings<\/a> testing. NHTSA does not test all cars, however, so we've also included 2017 vehicles that have not been tested by NHTSA but that have received the IIHS Top Safety Pick+ rating.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, all the SUVs on this list have the safety equipment that federal law requires, including front seat airbags for the driver and front passenger, tire-pressure monitoring systems and electronic stability control (ESC). ESC incorporates antilock brakes and traction control. <\/p>\n\n<p>We've also listed some of the key safety features in each car and safety-related extras that might interest you. When Edmunds has tested a vehicle, we show the results of our own brake tests. The SUVs are listed alphabetically within two size groups: compact SUVs and midsize SUVs. No large SUVs achieved the IIHS Top Safety Pick+ designation.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Compact SUVs<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/mazda\/cx-3\/2017\/suv\/\">2017 Mazda CX-3<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"\/\/services.edmunds-media.com\/image-service\/media-ed\/ximm\/?quality=75&image=\/mazda\/cx-3\/2017\/fe\/2017_mazda_cx-3_f34_fe_222171_600.jpg\" alt=\"Safest SUVs of 2017\"><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.iihs.org\/iihs\/ratings\/vehicle\/v\/mazda\/cx-3-4-door-suv\/2017\" target=\"_blank\">IIHS Top Safety Pick+<\/a> (with optional front crash protection available in the <a href=\"\/\/www.mazda.com\/en\/innovation\/technology\/safety\/i-activsense\/\" target=\"_blank\">i-Activsense<\/a> package and optional LED projector headlights, both with the Grand Touring trim level)<\/p>\n\n<p>NHTSA 5-star overall rating <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Safety Features<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Standard:<\/strong><br>\n <ul class=\"list-style\"><li>Front seat side airbags<\/li>\n <li>Full-length side curtain airbags<\/li>\n <li>Rearview camera<\/li><\/ul><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Optional: <\/strong><br>\n <ul class=\"list-style\"><li>Adaptive cruise control<\/li>\n <li>Adaptive headlights<\/li>\n <li>Blind-spot monitoring<\/li>\n <li>Forward collision warning with automatic braking<\/li>\n <li>Lane departure warning<\/li>\n <li>Rear cross-traffic alert<\/li>\n <li>Pedestrian detection with automatic braking<\/li>\n <li>LED projector headlights<\/li><\/ul><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Something extra<\/strong>: Most of the optional advanced safety technologies are part of the available Mazda <a href=\"\/\/www.mazda.com\/en\/innovation\/technology\/safety\/i-activsense\/\" target=\"_blank\">i-Activsense<\/a> package.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Edmunds brake testing<\/strong>: In Edmunds testing, a front-wheel-drive Mazda CX-3 Grand Touring stopped from 60 mph in 121 feet, a slightly shorter than average distance for the class.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/mitsubishi\/outlander\/2017\/suv\/\">2017 Mitsubishi Outlander<\/a><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"\/\/services.edmunds-media.com\/image-service\/media-ed\/ximm\/?quality=75&image=\/mitsubishi\/outlander\/2017\/fe\/2017_mitsubishi_outlander_f34_fe_222171_600.jpg\" alt=\"Safest SUVs of 2017\"><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.iihs.org\/iihs\/ratings\/vehicle\/v\/mitsubishi\/outlander-4-door-suv\/2017\" target=\"_blank\">IIHS Top Safety Pick+<\/a> (all-wheel-drive models only;
